 * Schema.org/FloorPlan
 * A FloorPlan is an explicit representation of a collection of similar accommodations, allowing the provision of common information (room counts, sizes, layout diagrams) and offers for rental or sale.

A FloorPlan is always in the context of a particular place, either a larger [[ApartmentComplex]] or a single [[Apartment]]. The visual/spatial aspects of a floor plan (i.e. room layout, [see wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_plan)) can be indicated using [[image]].
