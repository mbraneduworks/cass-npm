	 * Schema.org/measurementTechnique
	 * A technique or technology used in a [[Dataset]] (or [[DataDownload]], [[DataCatalog]]),
corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (described using [[variableMeasured]]). This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but rather as a high level summary for dataset discovery.

For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence".

If the [[variableMeasured]] is "depression rating", the [[measurementTechnique]] could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".

If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]].
