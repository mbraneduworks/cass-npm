 * Schema.org/Accommodation
 * An accommodation is a place that can accommodate human beings, e.g. a hotel room, a camping pitch, or a meeting room. Many accommodations are for overnight stays, but this is not a mandatory requirement.
For more specific types of accommodations not defined in schema.org, one can use additionalType with external vocabularies.
