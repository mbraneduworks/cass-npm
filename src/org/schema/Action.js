/**
 * Schema.org/Action
 * An action performed by a direct agent and indirect participants upon a direct object. Optionally happens at a location with the help of an inanimate instrument. The execution of the action may produce a result. Specific action sub-type documentation specifies the exact expectation of each argument/role.\n\nSee also [blog post](http://blog.schema.org/2014/04/announcing-schemaorg-actions.html) and [Actions overview document](schema:docs/actions.html).
